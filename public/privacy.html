    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>
    <p><strong>Effective date:</strong> June 27, 2025</p>

    <p><strong>WorthIt</strong> is a Chrome extension designed to help Indian shoppers make smarter purchasing
        decisions. We are committed to protecting your privacy.</p>

    <h2>Data Collection</h2>
    <p>WorthIt does not collect, store, or transmit any personal data, browsing history, or user activity. All features,
        including cost-per-use calculations and time-to-afford metrics, operate entirely on your device.</p>

    <h2>Third-Party Sharing</h2>
    <p>We do not share any data with third parties, and we do not use analytics or external tracking services.</p>

    <h2>Permissions</h2>
    <p>Our extension uses Chrome permissions (such as <code>activeTab</code>) solely to display insights on the page
        you're viewing. These are required for the extension to function but do not involve data collection.</p>

    <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2>
    <p>If our privacy practices change, we will update this page accordingly.</p>
